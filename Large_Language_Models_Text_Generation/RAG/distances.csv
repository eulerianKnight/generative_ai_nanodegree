20,"The USGS Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) service estimated a 35 percent probability of economic losses between US$10 billion and US$100 billion. There was a 34 percent probability of economic losses exceeding US$100 billion. The service estimated a 36 percent probability of deaths between 10,000 and 100,000; 26 percent probability of deaths exceeding 100,000. For the second large earthquake, there was a 46 percent probability of deaths between 1,000 and 10,000; 30 percent probability of deaths between 100 and 1,000. The service also estimated a 35 percent percent probability of economic losses between US$1 billion and US$10 billion; 27 percent probability of economic losses between US$10 billion and US$100 billion.Risklayer estimated a death toll of between 23,284 and 105,671. According to geophysics professor, Övgün Ahmet Ercan, ""180,000 people or more may be trapped under the rubble, nearly all of them dead."" On 11 February, when the death toll was reported at about 28,000, United Nations emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths said the death toll was expected to ""more than double"". The World Health Organization said up to 26 million people may have been affected; 15 million in Turkey and 11 million in Syria.Shortly after the earthquakes the Turkish lira value struck a record low of 18.85 against the US dollar, but rebounded to its starting position at the end of the day. Turkish stock markets fell; main equities benchmark fell as much as 5 percent and banks fell 5.5 percent but recovered from the losses. The country's main stock market dropped 1.35 percent on 6 February. The Borsa Istanbul fell 8.6 percent on 7 February, and declined by more than 7 percent on the morning of 8 February before trading was suspended; the exchange then announced it would close for five days. Total costs of the earthquake damage in Turkey was estimated by the TÜRKONFED organization to be $84.1 billion US dollars; $70.75 billion on rebuilding, $10.4 billion loss in national income, and an additional $2.91 billion loss in workforce. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said potential losses of up to 1 percent of Turkey's GDP in 2023 could result. About half of residential property in the affected area is thought to be covered by Compulsory Earthquake Insurance. The United Nations Development Programme estimated between 116 million and 210 million tons of debris must be cleared in Turkey.In Syria, the World Bank estimated $5.1 billion worth of damages, excluding economic impact and losses. Nearly half that cost was direct damage to residential buildings and 18 percent on infrastructure. Aleppo Governate, the worst-affected governate, accounted for 45 percent of the damage cost (equivalent to about $2.3 billion), followed by Idlib and Lattakia governates. The amount of destroyed or damaged capital stock is about 10 percent of Syria's GDP.","[-0.00565063 -0.02241383  0.00731853 ...  0.0008668  -0.01820871

Development experts from the United Nations estimated that about 1.5 million people were left homeless.As of 13 March 2023, more than 55,700 deaths were confirmed: more than 48,400 in Turkey, and more than 7,200 in Syria. It is the deadliest earthquake in what is present day Turkey since the 526 Antioch earthquake, making it the deadliest natural disaster in its modern history. It is also the deadliest in what is present day Syria since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake; the deadliest worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake; and the fifth-deadliest of the 21st century. Damages were estimated at over US$100 billion in Turkey and US$5.1 billion in Syria, making them the fourth-costliest earthquakes on record.","[-0.00294703 -0.02162242 -0.01029019 ...  0.00730082 -0.01235474

The earthquake had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XII (Extreme) in parts of Antakya in Hatay Province. It was followed by a Mw 7.7 earthquake at 13:24. This earthquake was centered 95 km (59 mi) north-northeast from the first.

37,"The Turkish Government was criticized on social media for allegedly trying to cover up the fact that there were not two, but three mainshocks above Mw 7. However, professor Hasan Sözbilir, Director of Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) Earthquake Research and Application Center, told Anadolu Agency that there were only 2 mainshocks reaching above Mw 7 between 6 and 17 February 2023, but of the smaller quakes, there was one that reached Mw 6.7. Additional allegations were made when the death toll in Turkey was at 41,000, could in fact be up to five times higher. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was accused of manipulating the death toll of the earthquakes to mask the scale of the disaster amid growing criticism due to what many say was a delayed and ineffective response to the tragedy.The collapse of many newly constructed buildings caused public anger and doubts about the Turkish construction and contracting industry following seismic codes. After the 1999 İzmit earthquake, new building codes were enacted to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes. The quality of the concrete is often a factor in collapse, especially in older buildings, but the engineering and design of newer high rise buildings, and improper placement of support columns and beams, may contribute to collapse. The building codes, last updated in 2018, required quality standards in engineering design, construction and material. There were complaints that the building codes were poorly enforced.After the earthquake, Erdoğan had claimed ""98 percent of the destroyed buildings were built in before 1999"" and described it ""as the indicator of an improvement in the quality of building codes and enforcement"". Erdoğan's claim was criticized by civil engineer and earthquake engineering academic Haluk Sucuoğlu, stating that field observations and more than half of the buildings in earthquake-affected areas being built after 2000 making Erdoğan's claims unlikely, though accepting that concrete data on the destroyed buildings do not exist yet. The comparison of historical satellite images with those taken after the earthquake, especially of those showing the destruction in the newly built area of western Kahramanmaraş, were used to dispute Erdoğan's claim.In Adıyaman, the minister of transport and infrastructure, Adil Karaismailoğlu, and governor, Mahmut Çuhadar, were met with protests by locals. The state car of the governor was also kicked by protesters. Turkish engineers previously warned that cities could become 'graveyards' with building amnesty. Critics of President Erdoğan said contractors of housing projects were allowed to skip vital safety mandates which put residents at risk. Videos from several years ago showed President Erdoğan applauding housing projects which eventually collapsed. During a campaign stop in anticipation of the March 2019 local elections, he listed, among his government's top attainment, new housing in Kahramanmaras. President Erdoğan said ""We solved the problem of 144,156 citizens of Maras with zoning amnesty,"" In another video, he said ""We have solved the problems of 205,000 citizens of Hatay with zoning peace,""Before the 2018 general election, 3.1 million buildings were granted amnesty certificates, according to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Secretary General Assistant and city planner, Bugra Gokce. In the ten affected provinces, 294,165 certificates were granted; 59,247 in Adana; 10,629 in Adıyaman; 14,719 in Diyarbakır; 40,224 in Gaziantep; 56,464 in Hatay; 39,58 in Kahramanmaraş; 4,897 in Kilis; 22,299 in Malatya; 21,107 in Osmaniye; and 25,521 in Şanlıurfa. After a destructive earthquake struck İzmir in 2020, Asia Times said the Turkish government generated US$2 billion in profit since the latest zoning amnesty law was approved in May 2018. During that earthquake, there were 811,000 certificates linked to illegal construction in İzmir.The leader of the opposition in Parliament, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), pinned responsibility for the scale of the disaster on President Erdoğan. He demanded from the CHP mayors not to back down from providing bread and blankets to people in need and reject bureaucratic blocking as they did during the COVID-19 lockdown. It has also been reported that some donations from relief organizations arriving at the Adana airport were relabeled as assistance by the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) or also the governing AKP. Questions also arose as to how an ""earthquake tax"" (officially ""special communications tax"") levied by the Turkish government in the wake of the 1999 earthquake, estimated to have reached 88bn lira ($4.6bn; £3.8bn) and meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services, were spent, given how the government has never given a public explanation.Some Kurdish and Alevi residents alleged discrimination and neglect in the government's recovery efforts. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused Turkish authorities of preventing equal distribution of aid and favoring areas inhabited majorly by people loyal to the governing AKP.","[-0.00018135  0.00045083 -0.00526761 ... -0.00121521 -0.00546082

President Erdoğan said ₺15,000 in relocation assistance per household would be given to those whose homes were moderate, heavy or total destruction. Rent assistance of up to ₺5,000 would be given to homeowners and ₺2,000 to tenants.On 9 February, after touring the city of Gaziantep, Erdoğan promised to rebuild destroyed homes of survivors within one year. He also said the government is working on temporary accommodation for those made homeless. That same day, force majeure was imposed in the affected region and tax obligations between 6 February and 31 July 2023, were postponed until 31 July 2023.On 10 February, while touring Adıyaman Province, President Erdoğan reiterated the promise to rebuild all homes within one year, and added that the government will subsidize rents for those unwilling to stay in tents. He later added that more than 141,000 rescue personnel, including foreign teams, were working in the 10 affected provinces, that 100 billion lira (US$5.3 billion) were allocated to the disaster response. On 22 February, the Turkish government announced it plans to construct 200,000 homes in the cities of the 11 affected provinces and a further 70,000 in villages.Over 1.9 million people were rehoused in dormitories, guest houses, tents, hotels and containers. AFAD issued a statement on 16 February, detailing that 387,000 tents had been established in the affected area by local and international organizations. President Erdoğan said 890,000 survivors were placed in dormitories and 50,000 in hotels. He added that 1.6 million people had access to shelter.

30,"Syrian media reported a large number of buildings collapsing in the northern Aleppo Governorate, as well as several in the city of Hama. In Damascus, many people fled from their homes onto the streets. Syria's National Earthquake Centre said the earthquake is ""the biggest earthquake recorded"" in its operational history. According to SANA, the state news agency, President Bashar al-Assad held an emergency meeting with his cabinet to organize a rescue plan for the most hit regions. Following orders from President al-Assad, all teams of the civil defense, firefighting, health, and public construction groups were mobilized to Aleppo.The Syrian government appealed to UN member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations for international aid. Syria also requested for aid from the European Union's European Civil Protection Mechanism, according to commissioner Janez Lenarčič. The Syrian government, through its representative in the United Nations, said that it should be responsible for aid distribution in all areas of the country, including those held by the rebels. The UK government said it would deliver aid through its long-term partners, the White Helmets civilian defense force. The US State Department said it would use its humanitarian partners on the ground.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said damaged roads and logistical issues prevented the mobilization of international aid across the border from Turkey. Border crossings into Turkey remained closed on 7 February. Critically injured patients were unable to enter Turkey for medical attention. There were exceptions as to which persons could cross, including individuals holding touristic residence permits who could only cross by foot. The Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing was made accessible on 8 February, according to the UN.Some hotels including in Latakia and Damascus offered to accommodate to survivors free of charge and ensure basic necessities. Refugees and expatriates also opened their homes as shelters for people. Al-Sham Private University started an effort to receive people. Sports facilities, events venues, university dormitories and halls were also opened to take in people. The Syria Trust for Development announced the establishment of shelters across many governorates. Volunteer groups inspected buildings for damage and distributed food items, blankets, and first aid essentials.Due to the high number of casualties, including trauma cases, many hospitals became overcrowded. Hospitals were already experiencing a shortage of medical supplies prior to the earthquake. Hospitals in many cities were forced to operate far beyond capacity. Many patients at hospitals slept on floors due to the lack of beds. The Ministry of Health dispatched medical convoys from the Health Directorates of Damascus, Rif Dimashq Governorate, Quneitra, Homs, and Tartus, to Aleppo and Latakia to rebel-held areas. Twenty-eight ambulances, seven mobile clinics, and four trucks carrying medical, surgical and emergency aid were also dispatched. Local charities across the country, which typically distribute food during the month of Ramadan, have been exhausted to their fullest capacity. One of these charities, Saed Initiative, planned to establish a charity kitchen to provide free meals for the rest of the year. Between 2,500 and 4,000 meals were distributed every day in Aleppo, and the charity plans to distribute up to 40,000 meals every day. Another charity in the city, the al-Bir and al-Ihsan charity, provided 1,500 meals every day.Over 2,000 Syria Civil Defense (White Helmets) volunteers were sent to all the affected areas to conduct search and rescue efforts. With a lack of equipment and tools, they appealed to other humanitarian organizations for support. Officials on 7 February announced rescue and recovery efforts in Hama ended after 15 hours. Over 298,000 people were left without homes and 180 shelters were opened in government-held areas. About 30,000 people were housed in shelters in Aleppo. As of 10 February, no international rescue workers had arrived in rebel-held Jinderis despite official calls for help.United States sanctions against Syria relating to the blocking of banks and payment processors led to the banning of international charities and families attempting to send money to people affected in Syria. On 7 February 2023, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent urged Western countries to lift sanctions against Syria, saying the measures hurt civilians and humanitarian efforts during the earthquake recovery effort. The sanctions are a series of economic measures taken by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and the Arab League from the start of the civil war in 2011. They include an oil embargo and the freezing of financial assets of the state and government officials. There were requests to lift or suspend the sanctions to aid humanitarian efforts following the earthquake. On 10 February, the United States announced it would exempt sanctions against Syria for 180 days. The ease of sanctions was for ""all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts"", according to the United States Department of the Treasury. The Syrian Ministry responded in a statement that the US' decision was ""misleading and aims to give a false humanitarian impression"" and that ""the facts on the ground proved its falsehood."" Some commentators have argued that the sanctions do not pose a problem for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria.International humanitarian assistance began entering northwestern Syria on 9 February via Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. The first convoy of six trucks carried tents and sanitary items. Turkey said it was working to open two additional border crossings. On 10 February, 14 trucks carrying aid crossed from Turkey into Syria, according to the United Nations. The United States Central Command announced it would cooperate with Syrian Democratic Forces to assist the affected population in Syria. On 11 February, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Aleppo, accompanying a shipment of emergency medical supplies. On 12 February, all schools across Syria, except for those in the affected areas, were resumed since the earthquakes struck. Schools in Aleppo, Lattakia, Hama and Idleb remained closed. On 14 February, the Syrian government agreed to open the border crossings at Bab al-Salam and al Raée for three months.","[-0.0113115   0.00997644 -0.01958091 ... -0.00316994 -0.01136464

11,"Satellite images captured by Sentinel-1 before and after the earthquakes revealed two zones of surface ruptures produced by the earthquakes. The longer of the pair, produced by the first earthquake, measured 300 km (190 mi) while the second earthquake produced 125 km (78 mi) of surface rupture.Surface rupture occurred along the East Anatolian Fault. According to AFAD, there was up to 400 km (250 mi) of surface rupture. It extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş Province and Gölbaşı, Adıyaman Province. Surface ruptures continued north of these cities. Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley. The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation. A major canal was damaged and lead to flooding in parts of the Amik Valley which was formerly Lake Amik. Field observations indicate a maximum displacement of 7.3 m (24 ft) on the surface. Geologists traced a 15 km (9.3 mi) surface rupture trending south from Pazarcık with an offset of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). From Golbasi to Nurdağı ground displacements were up to 5 m (16 ft).The inland rupture is one of the longest in the world—comparable to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake which ruptured along the San Andreas Fault. A professor of geophysics at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia said the earthquake may have ruptured over 300 km (190 mi) of fault. It is thought to have ruptured sections of the East Anatolian Fault and Dead Sea Transform. Shinji Toda, a seismologist at Tohoku University, called it the ""worst inland shallow earthquake"" of the century.Large inland strike-slip earthquakes have occurred in the past. In 1905, two Mw 8.0+ inland earthquakes struck Mongolia, producing a combined 676 km (420 mi) of surface rupture. The sequence began with the Tsetserleg earthquake. The Bulnay earthquake which occurred 14 days later generated about 388 km (241 mi) of surface rupture striking east–west. In 2002, a Mw 7.9 earthquake occurred in Alaska; it ruptured the Denali and Totschunda faults, producing 340 km (210 mi) of surface rupture on both faults. In 1976, a Mw 7.5 earthquake ruptured at least 250 km (160 mi) of the Motagua Fault in Guatemala; the fault represents a boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates.","[-0.00385007 -0.01468464  0.03011246 ...  0.00305701 -0.02489646

10,"A geologist from Middle East Technical University said the first M>7 earthquake may have ruptured multiple segments along the East Anatolian Fault; initiating along the Narlı Fault. The Narlı Fault represents the northernmost section of the Dead Sea Transform. The rupture transition onto the East Anatolian Fault; propagating southwest along the Amanos and northeast along the Pazarcık-Erkenek segments. Scientists from Istanbul Technical University said five separate faults ruptured during the first earthquake. A professor at the university said although the East Anatolian Fault was the main structure which ruptured, other faults branching away from it also ruptured. A researcher at the California Institute of Technology said a 55 km (34 mi) portion of the East Anatolian Fault between the 2023 and 2020 earthquakes remained unruptured. A Mw 6.8 aftershock occurring 11 minutes later and west of the first M>7 epicenter may have ruptured along the Salçagöz Fault.The second M>7 earthquake initiated on a separate fault known as the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone. within the greater East Anatolian Fault. The fault responsible is not part of the main East Anatolian Fault strand but another east–west trending fault located to the west. The rupture propagated eastwards to Malatya along the northeast–southwest trending Doğanşehir Fault Zone. Rupture also propagated towards the south at the western end of the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone. The total rupture length was estimated at 160 km (99 mi). Scientist Ross Stein said the earthquake could be considered a ""contingent event""; had the previous large earthquake not occur, it likely would not have occurred as well. Coulomb stress transfer from the first earthquake brought the Sürgü and Çardak faults closer to failure, which ruptured during the second earthquake.","[-0.00742385 -0.02658742  0.00439052 ...  0.0159063  -0.00569003

15,"In İskenderun, an industrial city in Hatay Province, a large fire at the port was reported on 6 February at 17:00, believed to have originated from a container carrying flammable industrial oil, forcing the port's closure and the diversion of many ships. It was extinguished on 6 and 8 February, only for it to reignite the next day each time. It was finally extinguished on 10 February. A total of 3,670 containers were destroyed by the fire and the port managing authority said it would take three months for operations to resume. Flooding occurred along the city shoreline, inundating streets up to 200 m (660 ft) inland. The Cathedral of the Annunciation, seat of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Anatolia, was almost completely destroyed. There were no collapses or major damage in Erzin despite being closer to the epicenter than other areas of Hatay Province. Multiple factors including strict building codes prevented destruction. An estimated 20,000 people fled to Erzin, increasing its population by about 50 percent.Mass burials occurred in Kahramanmaraş for more than 5,000 bodies. A city official said the mass grave would eventually be the burial ground for 10,000 bodies. The Interior Ministry later confirmed 941 buildings were totally collapsed. In Elbistan, 924 people died and 1,825 were injured. An estimated 2,000 buildings were destroyed. At Ordekdede, a village in Pazarcik District, almost all single-story buildings were decimated. None of the 140 houses in the village were structurally stable. Thirty-four people died in the village. At least 11 people died, 107 houses were destroyed and 70 percent of the building stock were damaged in Ekinözü. In Afşin, at least 180 people died. At least 335 buildings including 90 in the city center were destroyed. The Afşin-Elbistan Thermal Power Plant was also damaged. In Ericek, a village in Göksun with a population of about 2,500 people, 86 died.In Adıyaman Province, over 20,000 buildings and 56,600 apartments were destroyed. In the city of Adıyaman, four neighborhoods were razed. Many buildings along Atatürk Boulevard collapsed. The city hall, a 6th-century mosque and Gölbaşı District's state hospital were also destroyed. Isias Hotel, the largest hotel in the city, also collapsed, killing 65 people. Up to 10 percent of Adıyaman's population perished. The mayor of Kömür said the Karapınar and Bahçelievler neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. Destruction was also observed in Barbaros, Çelikhan, Sümerevler and Karapınar districts. In Harmanlı, a village in Gölbaşı District, 80–90 percent of it was destroyed. The second earthquake destroyed three buildings in the province.In Diyarbakir Province, 8,086 buildings were damaged, required demolition or were destroyed. Diyarbakır Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was also partly destroyed. The adjacent World Heritage Site of Hevsel Gardens was also damaged. Part of the Galeria complex in Yenişehir, which included a shopping mall and dozens of apartments collapsed, killing 89 and injuring 22.At least 466 buildings were heavily damaged in Şanlıurfa Province; 201 were destroyed. Structures around the Pool of Abraham were damaged. The minaret at the religious shrine partially collapsed, sending rubble into the pools below and discoloring the water, which was also contaminated by sewage. In Eyyübiye District, the minaret of the Eyüp Prophet Mosque was damaged and removed. Thirty-three people were killed in the collapse of the Osman Ağan Apartment.In Osmaniye Province, of the 22,841 buildings surveyed, 1,739 were heavily damaged, destroyed or required urgent demolision.

According to the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, 25,000 search and rescue personnel were dispatched to the 10 affected provinces. At least 70 countries offered to help in search and rescue operations.Emergency services in Turkey rushed to search for survivors trapped under many collapsed buildings. By 8 February, more than 8,000 people were rescued from rubble across 10 provinces. About 380,000 individuals have taken refuge at relief shelters or hotels.An ""air aid corridor"" was established by the Turkish Armed Forces to mobilize search and rescue teams. Many military aircraft including an Airbus A400M and C-130 Hercules planes transported search and rescue teams and vehicles to the area. Food, blankets and psychological teams were also sent. Turkey sent an official request to NATO and allies for assistance.Over 53,000 Turkish emergency workers were deployed to the regions affected from the earthquakes. A team of 90 miners from Soma arrived at Osmaniye to provide assistance. The Izmir Metropolitan Municipality also sent dozens of vehicles and equipment.Poor weather conditions including snow, rain and freezing temperatures disrupted search and rescue efforts undertaken by rescue workers and civilians. Rescuers and volunteers wore winter clothing while searching for survivors. Damaged roads also slowed down aid delivery.On 8 February, Erdoğan visited the town of Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş Province and Hatay Province. He acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in the response to the earthquake, but denied that there was an insufficient number of personnel involved in rescue operations. He also described people saying they hadn't seen security forces at all in some areas as ""provocateurs"".AFAD announced on 19 February that search and rescue efforts in most of the affected provinces had ceased. The chairperson of AFAD, Yunus Sezer, said efforts would largely be discontinued by the night of 19 February.

It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing, but offered no information on the content of the posts. The number of detentions increased to a dozen on 8 February. Following reports of property being ransacked by looters, authorities arrested 98 people for robbery or defrauding victims. Syrians have faced increased discrimination in the country, with some Turks blaming them for the looting.On 9 February, the minister of justice, Bekir Bozdağ, said a judicial investigation into the collapse of buildings was opened. The probe attempts to hold accountable those who constructed the buildings or bore any responsibility for their collapse in the 10 hardest-hit provinces. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said: ""Those who have negligence, faults and those responsible for the destructions after the earthquake will be identified and held accountable before the judiciary"". Nearly 150 local prosecutors were authorized to establish units to investigate contractors, surveyors and other experts linked to the collapsed buildings.On 11 February, Turkey's justice ministry announced the plan to establish the ""Earthquake Crimes Investigation"" bureaus. The bureaus aim to hold contractors and other responsible for construction, gathering evidence, recommendation experts; including architects geologists and engineers; and inspecting building permits and occupation permits. Vice President Fuat Oktay said 131 individuals linked to the collapse of buildings were identified.By 25 February, 612 people were being investigated for their involvement in building collapses; 184 were arrested and awaiting trail. Those in jail included contractors and building owners and managers. On 12 February, the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued arrest warrants for 62 people; Thirty one arrests were made on 14 February. In Malatya, city prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 31 people.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published an article on 14 February covering journalists being detained and harassed for their reporting on the earthquake in Turkey. Some of those detained were being investigated for ""spreading misinformation"" or for """"provoking the people into animosity and hatred"" in connection with their reporting.The owner of the Renaissance Residence which collapsed in Hatay Province was arrested in Istanbul while attempting to leave Turkey for Montenegro. In Gaziantep Province, two people were arrested after being suspected of cutting-down columns to make extra space in a building that collapsed. Bekir Bozdağ said 163 people were being investigated for their alleged involvement. Eight people were arrested and awaiting trial while 48 were held in police detention; another seven were prohibited from leaving Turkey. Officials detained two people at Istanbul Airport attempting to flee to Georgia. Among those arrested were a man and his wife who constructed several buildings in Adiyaman which collapsed. A contractor involved in developing the Bahar Apartments in Gaziantep was detained in Istanbul after his inspections were deemed negligent. The owner of a construction company which built several buildings in Adana was apprehended in Northern Cyprus.The majority of buildings that collapsed in Turkey were constructed before 2000, but some were constructed after that year. Following the 1999 earthquake, building construction followed new regulations and had improved materials. Sukru Ersoy, a geology professor at Yıldız Technical University, said: ""corruption is high in the construction sector in Turkey. And therefore, there were abuses"". However, not all local authorities were corrupted. For instance, in Erzin, which had a strict stance against allowing the construction of buildings that violated safety codes in addition to having endured other earthquakes with less damage, became a popular location for victims from other areas to flee to as no collapsed buildings had been reported a week after the quake.","[-0.01409231 -0.01757088 -0.00194985 ...  0.0123051  -0.0137157

No earthquakes greater than magnitude 7.0 have been recorded on the fault since the instrumental period. In historic times, however, earthquakes up to magnitude 7.4 occurred. Tobin said the 6 February earthquakes were ""larger than what was most likely anticipated"". He added that it is not uncommon for rupture on one fault to trigger rupture on another. The 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California were produced by rupture along two faults.A source model produced by the USGS indicated the Mww 7.8 earthquake ruptured three fault segments with individual lengths × widths of >40 km (25 mi) × 30 km (19 mi) (Segment 1), >175 km (109 mi) × 30 km (19 mi) (Segment 2) and >160 km (99 mi) × 20 km (12 mi) (Segment 3). The rupture initiated along Segment 1—Segment 1 branches out from Segment 2 in a southwest direction. It propagated northeast along Segment 2 and southwest along Segment 3. The mainshock produced a maximum slip of 11.2 m (37 ft) along Segment 2, beneath Sakarya in Kahramanmaraş Province, northeast of the junction where it meets Segment 1. Another zone of large slip estimated at 4.96 m (16.3 ft) occurred northeast along Segment 2, northwest of Adıyaman.The Mw 7.7 earthquake which struck nine hours later ruptured three large fault segments.

4,"Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three tectonic plates, the African Plate, the Arabian Plate and the Anatolian Plate. The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST), which is a major zone of left-lateral strike-slip that accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa. The northern end of the DST truncates at the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) another major zone of left-lateral strike-slip that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian Plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian Plate. The DST and EAF meet at the Marash Triple Junction. The EAF continues west of the triple junction,  forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the Cyprus arc to the west via the Latakia Ridge.The 700-kilometre-long East Anatolian Fault has been subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast the Karlıova, Ilıca, Palu, Pütürge, Erkenek, Pazarcık and Amanos. The Amanos segment is also considered to be part of the DST by some workers, or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others. A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognised, including the Sürgü, Çardak, Savrun, Çokak, Toprakkale, Yumurtalık, Karataş, Yakapınar and Düziçi–İskenderun segments. The estimated slip rate on the main strand of the EAF system decreases south-westwards from 10 mm per year on the Karlıova segment down to 2.9 mm per year on the Amanos segment. On the northern strand, slip rates of 2.5 mm per year have been estimated on the Çardak segment.The northern part of the Dead Sea Transform has been subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between workers as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure. Following the 2013 ""Active Fault Map of Turkey"", seven DST segments are recognised in Turkey and neighbouring parts of Syria, the Afrin, Sermada, Armanaz, Hacıpaşa, Yesemek, Sakçagöz and Narlı segments.","[-0.00633828 -0.01243955  0.01507373 ...  0.02426966 -0.016252

There were reports of unsuccessful attempts by people to contact AFAD. Emergency management academic Kubilay Kaptan stated that the delayed reaction of AFAD was mainly caused by the increasing centralization of Turkish emergency response agencies under the current government. According to Kaptan, numerous relief agencies were merged into AFAD in the past years and since the implementation of the referendum, AFAD became part of the Ministry of Interior, losing its autonomy and self-governance. Kaptan added thatt the Ministry of Interior, responsible for making decisions, hindered the fast response since the organization required approval for its actions, contrasting more independent agencies like FEMA in the United States. AFAD was also criticized on the claims of inappropriate board of management, since some members of the board had no disaster management background. İsmail Palakoğlu, the general manager of disaster response subdivision of AFAD, is a theologian who previously worked at the Directorate of Religious Affairs, was criticized by several politicians and media outlets.Another criticism was the late deployment of military resources. They were not mobilized for two days after the earthquake, and even then in what many considered in very modest amounts. In the past, local commanders were authorized to go into action unilaterally in the face of such a natural disaster until the current government changed the regulations. There were many instances where aid was forced to go through local governors, who were not elected but appointed by the government. In some instances, aid was held by the ruling party with the explanation that it would be managed by AFAD. There were reports of aid trucks stopped and not let through unless ruling party placards and signs were placed on them, including stickers of the president placed on individual aid packages.
